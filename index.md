Welcome to my personal site!

I am an embedded/automotive engineer with >10 years experience in software development. My passion is to contribute to architectural design and development of complex embedded systems with resource constraints and untrivial solutions.

Currently living in Berlin. Worked in [Apex.AI](https://apex.ai) and [Mbition](https://mbition.io).
