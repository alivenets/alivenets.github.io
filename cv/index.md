	SW Force, MBiENT in-vehicle infotainment system project<br/>

	<ul>
		<li>Led the development of the core Dynamic Content subsystem. The components enable the deployment of in-car applications in the new Mercedes-Benz in-vehicle infotainment system (MBiENT). Extensively used the kernel features (cgroups, namespaces, AppArmor) to implement container isolation. Among deployment and execution, the key considerations were security, resource utilization, robustness, and performance</li>
		<li>Facilitated the transition to a new containerization stack that proved to be more robust and testable</li>
		<li>In a limited time frame, wrote design documents and coded components to perform OTA using OMA/DM</li>
		<li>Implemented a CNI plugin to enforce custom network rules for containerized applications. The plugin allowed to adhere to the strict constraints of the network in Head Unit</li>
		<li>Wrote CMake module library for standard developer workflow which is widely used by the project developers</li>
